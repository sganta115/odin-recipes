    <h3>BO2 fire staff</h3>
    <p>The fire staff is a great wonder weapon that is powerful and easy to obtain. Although not as effective as the 
        ice staff for high rounds, it is still useful for rounds reaching the 70s. It is also much safer than the Ice
        staff, having savior effects similar to the lightning staff.
